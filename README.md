## ü§ñ üê≥

This repo contains a set of tools for managing docker containers and (ROS) images with transparent support of **Nvidia drivers**. You can play with it to create your own custom docker containers. If you are new to docker or looking for a quick cheatsheet start [here](docker_commands.md).

**Main features**:
- You can run a container and transparently attach many terminals to it: text and color of the bash prompt will inform you where you are. 
- Each container shares its network interface with the host.
- GUIs can be run from each container terminal (Nvidia drivers are transparently managed). For instance, you can run `rviz`.  
- Your favorite working folder is conveniently mounted into the docker containers when you run them. 
  
## Requirements

Check you have installed the *[nvidia-docker-toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html#tab-0-0-0)*:   
`$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit-base`  

## Usage

### Configuration 

In the file [config.sh](./config.sh), set your favorite *working folder* `WORKING_FOLDER_TO_MOUNT_IN_CONTAINER`. This folder will be mounted from the host into the run container so that we can continue our work within the container (and preserve our changes). By default:    
`WORKING_FOLDER_TO_MOUNT_IN_CONTAINER="$HOME/Work"`       


### Build and run  

Build and run a container `<CONTAINER_NAME>`: 
* Build the container     
`$ ./build.sh <CONTAINER_NAME>`     
* Run the container from a first terminal (that spawns the container)    
`$ ./run.sh <CONTAINER_NAME>`     
* Connect a new terminal to the same container    
`$ ./run.sh <CONTAINER_NAME>`     
* Stop the container     
`$ ./stop.sh <CONTAINER_NAME>`     

For instance, if you want to run and build the `noetic` container (see [next section](#available-containers-and-dockerfiles) for available containers), then run:   
`$ ./build.sh noetic`     
`$ ./run.sh noetic`    
`$ ./stop.sh noetic`   

**NOTE1**: When you update your Nvidia drivers, rebuild the container with the `build.sh` script. 

**NOTE2**: any change made outside of our folder `WORKING_FOLDER_TO_MOUNT_IN_CONTAINER` from within the docker environment will not persist. If you want to add additional binary packages without having to reinstall them each time, add them to the Dockerfile and rebuild. This is a trivial thing for normal docker users. 

## Available Images and Dockerfiles 

Each container `<CONTAINER_NAME>` listed below corresponds to a dockerfile: `Dockerfile_<CONTAINER_NAME>`. 

- `melodic` built on the top of `ros:melodic-ros-base-bionic` (`ubuntu:18.04`)
- `noetic` built on the top of `ros:noetic-ros-base-focal` (`ubuntu:20.04`)
- `noetic_3dmr` built on top of the previous `noetic` and installing all the deps of [3DMR](https://github.com/luigifreda/3dmr.git))  (`ubuntu:20.04`)
- `ubuntu20` built on top of `ubuntu:20.04` (no ROS)
- `humble`  built on the top of `ros:humble` (`ubuntu:22.04`)
- `ubuntu22` built on top of `ubuntu:22.04` (no ROS)
  
An old heritage:  
- `tradr` (built on the top of `ros:indigo`) (`ubuntu:14.04`) (it was used during the [TRADR](https://www.tradr-project.eu/) program)

Now, you can easily add your new custom one. 

## 3DMR 

In order to run the `noetic_3dmr`container, which can host the [3DMR project](https://github.com/luigifreda/3dmr), check you are connected to the network and run:     
`$ ./build.sh noetic`     
`$ ./build.sh noetic_3dmr`      

Now, set your folder `$WORKING_FOLDER_TO_MOUNT_IN_CONTAINER` (see the [configuration](#configuration) section). From your host, open a terminal and clone the [3DMR](https://github.com/luigifreda/3dmr) project into `$WORKING_FOLDER_TO_MOUNT_IN_CONTAINER`. Then, run the container `noetic_3dmr`:    
`$ ./run.sh noetic_3dmr`.      
Next, from within the run container, get into the folder `$WORKING_FOLDER_TO_MOUNT_IN_CONTAINER`, and build the workspace (see the instructions and scripts in [3DMR](https://github.com/luigifreda/3dmr)). 

## Troubleshooting 

If you get the following error related to permission problems:
```
Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Post ": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
```
then run the following commands:
```
$ sudo groupadd -f docker
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
$ newgrp docker
$ sudo service docker restart
```
